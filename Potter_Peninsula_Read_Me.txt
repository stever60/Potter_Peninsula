Chronological and sedimentological studies from Potter Peninsula, South Shetland Islands.

These folders contain data and code for stratigraphic chronological and sedimentological data and data compilations from Potter Peninsula, King George Island, and the South Shetland Islands. 

The data have been used to constrain deglaciation and glacier dynamics on Potter Peninsula. 

The code folder contains R code and data used to analyse the data and construct figures for the following submitted manuscripts: 

Heredia Barión P, Roberts SJ, Spiegel C, Binnie SA, Wacker L, Davies J, et al. (submitted - a) Mid–late Holocene deglaciation and glacier readvances on the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, NW Antarctic Peninsula. The Holocene.
